            <p><h1 style="color:rgb(188, 14, 14);text-align:center;">E-SPORTS</h1><hr></p>Esports, short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video games.[1] Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity.[2][3] By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events.

            The most common video game genres associated with esports are multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), first-person shooter (FPS), fighting, card, battle royale and real-time strategy (RTS) games. Popular esports franchises include League of Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike, Valorant, Overwatch, Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros. and StarCraft, among many others. Tournaments such as the League of Legends World Championship, Dota 2's International, the fighting game-specific Evolution Championship Series (EVO) and Intel Extreme Masters are among the most popular in esports. Many other competitions use a series of league play with sponsored teams, such as the Overwatch League. Although the legitimacy of esports as a true sporting competition remains in question, they have been featured alongside traditional sports in some multinational events in Asia, with the International Olympic Committee also having discussed their inclusion into future Olympic events.
            
            By the late 2010s, it was estimated that the total audience of esports would grow to 454 million viewers, with revenue increasing to more than US$1 billion, with China accounting for 35% of the global esports revenue in 2020.[4][5] The increasing availability of online streaming media platforms, particularly YouTube and Twitch, have become central to the growth and promotion of esports competitions.[3] Despite viewership being approximately 85% male and 15% female, with a majority of viewers between the ages of 18 and 34, female gamers have also played professionally.[6][7][8] The popularity and recognition of esports first took place in Asia, seeing significant growth in China and South Korea, with the latter having licensed professional players since 2000. Despite its large video game industry, esports in Japan is relatively underdeveloped, with this being largely attributed to its broad anti-gambling laws which prohibit paid professional gaming tournaments.[9][10] Outside of Asia, esports are also popular in Europe and the Americas, with both regional and international events taking place in those regions.

            <br>The earliest known video game competition took place on 19 October 1972 at Stanford University for the game Spacewar. Stanford students were invited to an "Intergalactic spacewar olympics" whose grand prize was a year's subscription for Rolling Stone, with Bruce Baumgart winning the five-man-free-for-all tournament and Tovar and Robert E. Maas winning the team competition.[11]

            Contemporary esports has roots in competitive face-to-face arcade video game competitions. A forerunner of esports was held by Sega in 1974, the All Japan TV Game Championships, a nationwide arcade video game tournament in Japan.[12][13][14] The tournament was intended by Sega to promote the play and sales of video games in the country. There were local tournaments held in 300 locations across Japan, and then sixteen finalists from across the country competed in the final elimination rounds at Tokyo's Hotel Pacific. Prizes awarded included television sets (color and black-and-white), cassette tape recorders and transistor radios. According to Sega, the tournament "proved to be the biggest event ever" in the arcade game industry, and was attended by members from leading Japanese newspapers and leisure industry companies.[12] Sega stressed “the importance of such tournaments to foster better business relationships between the maker-location-customer and create an atmosphere of competition on TV amusement games".[13][12] In 1977, Gremlin Industries (a year before being acquired by Sega) held a marketing stunt to promote their early arcade snake game Hustle in the United States, involving the "Gremlin Girls" who were a duo of professional female arcade players called Sabrina Osment and Lynn Reid.[15][16] The pair travelled across 19 American cities, where players could challenge them in best-of-three matches for a chance to win money. The duo were challenged by a total of 1,300 players, only about seven of whom managed to beat them.[16]</p>

Most people recognize the names Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Tom Brady, figures often seen as the faces of their respective sports. 
Names like Lee “Faker” Sang-Hyeok, Luka “Perkz” Perković, and Kim “Doinb” Tae-sang may not have quite the same recognition yet, 
but these athletes are also becoming global superstars.

Faker, Perkz, and Doinb are all professional players of the world’s most popular computer-based video game: League of Legends.
League is one of many games that host competitions of increasing fanfare and popularity, part of the rapidly expanding genre of electronic sports.

Esports, as they are most commonly called, are in an international gray area. Their enormous popularity—some events routinely draw more than a
million concurrent viewers— make esport athletes attractive options for lucrative corporate sponsorships, but the fluidity of esports over
international boundaries and lack of defined rules make them incredibly complex. This four-part article will seek to explain the global phenomenon
of esports, provide a comprehensive view into their functionality and practicality, and outline why they ought to be considered an integral, albeit
turbulent, part of our constantly changing internet culture. The article series will dive into the unique challenges everyone—players, governments,
teams, franchises, corporate sponsors, and fans—face when engaging with esports. This part will introduce the reader to the general structures behind
video gaming and esports.

Simply put, esports are video games that are played in a highly organize competitive environment. These games can range from popular,team-oriented
multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), to single player first person shooters, to survival battle royales, to virtual reconstructions of physical sports.
    
The rise in this genre of video games comes as the young adult demographic has started to create and control a host of new cultural trends. Specifically
essential in this transformation is an evolution of young adults’ fundamental relationship with sports. Viewership of traditional sports is declining,
while that of esports is skyrocketing. The boom is so significant that almost every major popular video game on the market currently has some type of
pseudo-professional circuit (yes, even Farming Simulator 2019).
    
How did this transformation begin? The story begins in South Korea during the early 2000s. The South Korean government, in an attempt to soften a severe
financial crisis, focused on developing their internet and telecommunications infrastructure. Soon a wildly popular type of social space arose: PC bangs.
These were restaurants, bars, and other spaces that functioned as gaming clubs. These clubs became as ubiquitous as neighborhood basketball courts, places
where gamers would gather together, show off their skills to one another, and bond over a shared love for video gaming. Soon these places began holding
formal competitions.

Realizing the incredible market these spaces created, the Korean government got involved and created the Korean Esport Association (KeSPA), the first
governmental body dedicated to video game and esports regulation in the world. At the same time, a plethora of cheap television stations took off due
to the South Korean government’s telecommunication development program. One of these, Naver, was founded to focus extensively on covering esports.
This fusion between popular, competition-fostering social spaces and a free-access live streaming service dedicated to highly skilled players helped
esports grow into a popular part of Korean society.

The two games that emerged as the first real esports were Starcraft (1998)/Starcraft II (2010) and Defense of the Ancients 2 (2013), commonly known as DOTA 2,
developed by Activision Blizzard and Valve Corporation respectively. DOTA 2 gave rise to a robust network of small-scale tournaments, which over time, evolved
into massive, privately organized competitions. Of the two however, the Starcrafts proved to be more popular in the Korean circuit, spawning the first developer
organized and sponsored gaming leagues, some of which continue today. DOTA 2 remained immensely popular, and its international championship currently boasts the
largest prize pool of any esport event, five and a half times more than the second largest prize pool; the 2019 DOTA 2 International had a winners prize 
popularity—some of US$13.5 million, out of a total prize pool of US$30.8 million, more than even some traditional sports like golf and ultimate fighting. </h3></pre></p>
